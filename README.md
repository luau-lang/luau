Luau
====

Luau is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from Lua. It is used by Roblox game developers to write game code, as well as by Roblox engineers to implement large parts of the user-facing application code as well as portions of the editor (Roblox Studio) as plugins.

This repository hosts documentation for the language as well as satellite materials, and can be viewed at https://luau-lang.org/
