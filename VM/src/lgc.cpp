/*
 * Luau uses an incremental non-generational non-moving mark&sweep garbage collector.
 *
 * The collector runs in three stages: mark, atomic and sweep. Mark and sweep are incremental and try to do a limited amount
 * of work every GC step; atomic is ran once per the GC cycle and is indivisible. In either case, the work happens during GC
 * steps that are "scheduled" by the GC pacing algorithm - the steps happen either from explicit calls to lua_gc, or after
 * the mutator (aka application) allocates some amount of memory, which is known as "GC assist". In either case, GC steps
 * can't happen concurrently with other access to VM state.
 *
 * Current GC stage is stored in global_State::gcstate, and has two additional stages for pause and second-phase mark, explained below.
 *
 * GC pacer is an algorithm that tries to ensure that GC can always catch up to the application allocating garbage, but do this
 * with minimal amount of effort. To configure the pacer Luau provides control over three variables: GC goal, defined as the
 * target heap size during atomic phase in relation to live heap size (e.g. 200% goal means the heap's worst case size is double
 * the total size of alive objects), step size (how many kilobytes should the application allocate for GC step to trigger), and
 * GC multiplier (how much should the GC try to mark relative to how much the application allocated). It's critical that step
 * multiplier is significantly above 1, as this is what allows the GC to catch up to the application's allocation rate, and
 * GC goal and GC multiplier are linked in subtle ways, described in lua.h comments for LUA_GCSETGOAL.
 *
 * During mark, GC tries to identify all reachable objects and mark them as reachable, while keeping unreachable objects unmarked.
 * During sweep, GC tries to sweep all objects that were not reachable at the end of mark. The atomic phase is needed to ensure
 * that all pending marking has completed and all objects that are still marked as unreachable are, in fact, unreachable.
 *
 * Notably, during mark GC doesn't free any objects, and so the heap size constantly grows; during sweep, GC doesn't do any marking
 * work, so it can't immediately free objects that became unreachable after sweeping started.
 *
 * Every collectable object has one of three colors at any given point in time: white, gray or black. This coloring scheme
 * is necessary to implement incremental marking: white objects have not been marked and may be unreachable, black objects
 * have been marked and will not be marked again if they stay black, and gray objects have been marked but may contain unmarked
 * references.
 *
 * Objects are allocated as white; however, during sweep, we need to differentiate between objects that remained white in the mark
 * phase (these are not reachable and can be freed) and objects that were allocated after the mark phase ended. Because of this, the
 * colors are encoded using three bits inside GCheader::marked: white0, white1 and black (so technically we use a four-color scheme:
 * any object can be white0, white1, gray or black). All bits are exclusive, and gray objects have all three bits unset. This allows
 * us to have the "current" white bit, which is flipped during atomic stage - during sweeping, objects that have the white color from
 * the previous mark may be deleted, and all other objects may or may not be reachable, and will be changed to the current white color,
 * so that the next mark can start coloring objects from scratch again.
 *
 * Crucially, the coloring scheme comes with what's known as a tri-color invariant: a black object may never point to a white object.
 *
 * At the end of atomic stage, the expectation is that there are no gray objects anymore, which means all objects are either black
 * (reachable) or white (unreachable = dead). Tri-color invariant is maintained throughout mark and atomic phase. To uphold this
 * invariant, every modification of an object needs to check if the object is black and the new referent is white; if so, we
 * need to either mark the referent, making it non-white (known as a forward barrier), or mark the object as gray and queue it
 * for additional marking (known as a backward barrier).
 *
 * Luau uses both types of barriers. Forward barriers advance GC progress, since they don't create new outstanding work for GC,
 * but they may be expensive when an object is modified many times in succession. Backward barriers are cheaper, as they defer
 * most of the work until "later", but they require queueing the object for a rescan which isn't always possible. Table writes usually
 * use backward barriers (but switch to forward barriers during second-phase mark), whereas upvalue writes and setmetatable use forward
 * barriers.
 *
 * Since marking is incremental, it needs a way to track progress, which is implemented as a gray set: at any point, objects that
 * are gray need to mark their white references, objects that are black have no pending work, and objects that are white have not yet
 * been reached. Once the gray set is empty, the work completes; as such, incremental marking is as simple as removing an object from
 * the gray set, and turning it to black (which requires turning all its white references to gray). The gray set is implemented as
 * an intrusive singly linked list, using `gclist` field in multiple objects (functions, tables, threads and protos). When an object
 * doesn't have gclist field, the marking of that object needs to be "immediate", changing the colors of all references in one go.
 *
 * When a black object is modified, it needs to become gray again. Objects like this are placed on a separate `grayagain` list by a
 * barrier - this is important because it allows us to have a mark stage that terminates when the gray set is empty even if the mutator
 * is constantly changing existing objects to gray. After mark stage finishes traversing `gray` list, we copy `grayagain` list to `gray`
 * once and incrementally mark it again. During this phase of marking, we may get more objects marked as `grayagain`, so after we finish
 * emptying out the `gray` list the second time, we finish the mark stage and do final marking of `grayagain` during atomic phase.
 * GC works correctly without this second-phase mark (called GCSpropagateagain), but it reduces the time spent during atomic phase.
 *
 * Sweeping is also incremental, but instead of working at a granularity of an object, it works at a granularity of a page: all GC
 * objects are allocated in special pages (see lmem.cpp for details), and sweeper traverses all objects in one page in one incremental
 * step, freeing objects that aren't reachable (old white), and recoloring all other objects with the new white to prepare them for next
 * mark. During sweeping we don't need to maintain the GC invariant, because our goal is to paint all objects with current white -
 * however, some barriers will still trigger (because some reachable objects are still black as sweeping didn't get to them yet), and
 * some barriers will proactively mark black objects as white to avoid extra barriers from triggering excessively.
 *
 * Most references that GC deals with are strong, and as such they fit neatly into the incremental marking scheme. Some, however, are
 * weak - notably, tables can be marked as having weak keys/values (using __mode metafield). During incremental marking, we don't know
 * for certain if a given object is alive - if it's marked as black, it definitely was reachable during marking, but if it's marked as
 * white, we don't know if it's actually unreachable. Because of this, we need to defer weak table handling to the atomic phase; after
 * all objects are marked, we traverse all weak tables (that are linked into special weak table lists using `gclist` during marking),
 * and remove all entries that have white keys or values. If keys or values are strong, they are marked normally.
 *
 * The simplified scheme described above isn't fully accurate because of threads, upvalues and strings.
 *
 * Strings are semantically black (they are initially white, and when the mark stage reaches a string, it changes its color and never
 * touches the object again), but they are technically marked as gray - the black bit is never set on a string object. This behavior
 * is inherited from Lua 5.1 GC, but doesn't have a clear rationale - effectively, strings are marked as gray but are never part of
 * a gray list.
 *
 * Threads are hard to deal with because for them to fit into the white-gray-black scheme, writes to thread stacks need to have barriers
 * that turn the thread from black (already scanned) to gray - but this is very expensive because stack writes are very common. To
 * get around this problem, threads have an "active" state which means that a thread is actively executing code. When GC reaches an active
 * thread, it keeps it as gray, and rescans it during atomic phase. When a thread is inactive, GC instead paints the thread black. All
 * API calls that can write to thread stacks outside of execution (which implies active) uses a thread barrier that checks if the thread is
 * black, and if it is it marks it as gray and puts it on a gray list to be rescanned during atomic phase.
 *
 * Upvalues are special objects that can be closed, in which case they contain the value (acting as a reference cell) and can be dealt
 * with using the regular algorithm, or open, in which case they refer to a stack slot in some other thread. These are difficult to deal
 * with because the stack writes are not monitored. Because of this open upvalues are treated in a somewhat special way: they are never marked
 * as black (doing so would violate the GC invariant), and they are kept in a special global list (global_State::uvhead) which is traversed
 * during atomic phase. This is needed because an open upvalue might point to a stack location in a dead thread that never marked the stack
 * slot - upvalues like this are identified since they don't have `markedopen` bit set during thread traversal and closed in `clearupvals`.
