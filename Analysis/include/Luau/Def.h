 * A cell is a "single-object" value.

 * Leaky implementation note: sometimes "multiple-object" values, but none of which were interesting enough to warrant creating a phi node instead.
 * That can happen because there's no point in creating a phi node that points to either resultant in `if math.random() > 0.5 then 5 else "hello"`.
 * This might become of utmost importance if we wanted to do some backward reasoning, e.g. if `5` is taken, then `cond` must be `truthy`.

 * A phi node is a union of cells.
 *
 * We need this because we're statically evaluating a program, and sometimes a place may be assigned with
 * different cells, and when that happens, we need a special data type that merges in all the cells
 * that will flow into that specific place. For example, consider this simple program:
 *
 * ```
 * x-1
 * if cond() then
 *   x-2 = 5
 * else
 *   x-3 = "hello"
 * end
 * x-4 : {x-2, x-3}
 * ```
 *
 * At x-4, we know for a fact statically that either `5` or `"hello"` can flow into the variable `x` after the branch, but
 * we cannot make any definitive decisions about which one, so we just take in both.

 * can hold a Luau value, and then observes how those defs will commute as it statically evaluate the program.
 *
 * It must also be noted that defs are a cyclic graph, so it is not safe to recursively traverse into it expecting it to terminate.
