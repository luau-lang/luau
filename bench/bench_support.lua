-- This function acts a bit like a Unix "fork" operation
-- When it is first called it clones `scriptInstance` and starts executing
-- the cloned script parented to an Actor.  When the cloned script calls "runScriptCodeUnderActor"
-- it will run 'f' and print out the provided 'description'.
--
-- The function returns 'true' if it was invoked from a script running under an Actor
-- and 'false' otherwise.
--
-- Example usage:
--   local bench = script and require(script.Parent.bench_support) or require("bench_support")
--   function testFunc()
--      ...
--   end
--   bench.runScriptCodeUnderActor(script, testFunc, "test function")
